# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting car prices based on various features of the cars using logistic regression techniques. The project implements both standard logistic regression and ridge logistic regression to classify cars into different price categories.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify cars into different price categories based on their specifications, such as mileage, engine capacity, and power. By employing machine learning algorithms, we can provide insights into car prices, which can be beneficial for both sellers and buyers in the automotive market.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Cars.csv`, which contains the following features:
- **name**: Car brand and model
- **mileage**: Distance the car can cover per liter of fuel
- **engine**: Engine capacity (in cc)
- **max_power**: Maximum power of the car (in bhp)
- **km_driven**: Total kilometers driven by the car
- **seats**: Number of seats in the car
- **fuel**: Type of fuel used
- **transmission**: Type of transmission (Manual/Automatic)
- **seller_type**: Type of seller (Individual/Dealer)
- **owner**: Number of previous owners
- **selling_price**: Price at which the car is being sold

The target variable is `price_category`, which categorizes the selling price into four classes.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Data**: Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Clean the data and encode categorical variables.
3. **Train the Model**: Use the provided classes to train the Logistic Regression and Ridge Logistic Regression models.
4. **Evaluate the Models**: Use the classification report to assess model performance.
5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Data Processing

### Step 1: Data Cleaning
The data is first cleaned by:
- Dropping unnecessary columns (like `torque`).
- Removing any rows with missing or duplicate values.

### Step 2: Feature Extraction
The `get_brand_name` function extracts the brand name from the car name, and a `clean_data` function processes the numerical values to ensure they are in the correct format.

### Step 3: Encoding Categorical Variables
Categorical variables are replaced with numeric values to prepare the data for model training:
- Car brands are assigned unique integer values.
- The transmission type, seller type, fuel type, and owner categories are also encoded similarly.

### Step 4: Creating Price Categories
The `selling_price` is binned into categories (0, 1, 2, 3) based on price ranges, making it suitable for classification tasks.

### Step 5: Feature Scaling
The features are then scaled using `StandardScaler` to standardize the data, which improves the performance of the logistic regression algorithms.

## Model Training

Two classes are defined for model training:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Ridge Logistic Regression** (with L2 regularization)

Both models implement methods for:
- Fitting the model to the training data (`fit` method).
- Predicting probabilities and class labels (`predict` method).
- Calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Code Example
```python
class LogisticRegression:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.num_iterations = num_iterations

    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Model training logic here
```

## Evaluation

After training, the models are evaluated using the classification report from `sklearn`, which provides metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in understanding the performance of each model in predicting the price categories.

### Code Example
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

y_pred_logistic = logistic_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
print("Logistic Regression Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred_logistic))
```

## Making Predictions

The trained models can be used to predict price categories for new car data. The `load_model_and_predict` function demonstrates how to load a saved model and make predictions on sample data.

### Code Example
```python
def load_model_and_predict(model_path, test_data):
    with open(model_path, 'rb') as file:
        model = pickle.load(file)
    return model.predict(test_data)

# Example test data
test_data_samples = [
    [15, 1200, 90, 50000, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # Category 0
    ...
]

# Predict categories
predictions_logistic = load_model_and_predict("Logistic_Regression_Model.pkl", test_data_scaled)
```
